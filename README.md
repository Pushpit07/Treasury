# Treasury: Ocean of Encrypted Files

<img src="./treasury.png" alt="Treasury Homepage">

## Inspiration
The current cloud file-sharing/storing platforms aren’t secure and free. The data stored by centralized platforms can’t be completely trusted. There have been various cases of servers being hacked and information stolen. One couldn’t trust such platforms to store sensitive information. There’s also the storage limit and the price barrier that is particularly miserly. These cons of the centralized web2 platforms inspired us to develop a blockchain-based secure and robust file-sharing/storing platform.

In today’s world, there are several solutions for web3 file storage, but still, not all solutions are perfect for every use case. IPFS is the largest storage solution for web3 but it lacks privacy. We need better privacy for file storage in web3 and Treasury provides that by storing encrypted files on IPFS.

## What it does
Treasury is a platform that stores encrypted files on IPFS and helps users retain the privacy of their data. We have created a platform through which users can store/share/upload any number of files on IPFS without any storage limit, that too securely!

## What we learned and how we built the project?
“Effective planning makes the execution smooth”. We spent quite a time brainstorming on choosing the right problem to solve. After that, we planned everything- from blueprints to wireframes, from MVP development to the final development. We divided our product development into phases with deadlines and that planning ultimately helped us to smoothly execute all the ideas that we had. And yes, we learned how to work in a team, how to complete tasks in a fast-paced environment, how to bring life to ideas, and so on.

Here's a quick overview of the whole journey of building File Treasury:

Brainstorming and in-depth research on file-sharing and storing platforms
Assigning roles and responsibilities to team members
Creating a simple design language for the platform
UI/UX wireframing
Phase 1: Designing and developing MVP
Phase 2: Testing and fixing bugs
Fixing some more bugs : )
Final testing & uploading project on GitHub
Registering the domain filetreasury.co. It’s cool! Isn't it?

## Challenges we ran into
- Bugs, bugs, and bugs.
- Encryption and decryption of files over the web.
- We had a steep learning curve in integrating IPFS technology with our project to make it secure and robust.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Through this project, we can create an impact and we're proud to have accomplished the project in such a short time and look forward to introducing it to the entire world.

## What's next for Treasury
We're planning to build an API for Treasury so that developers could integrate our service into their applications to make secure products for the wider public.

## How to setup

-   Fork the repo to your account

-   Clone the forked repo to your local system using `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Treasury.git`

-   Connect your local repo to the upstream using `git remote add upstream https://github.com/<your-username>/Treasury`

-   Run `npm install` to install npm dependencies

-   Run `npm run dev` to start the application

## How to contribute?

-   **DO NOT** make and push changes to the main branch!

-   **Always** keep your main/working branch in sync with the main repository `git pull upstream main` on the branch you are working on locally.

-   **Always create a new branch** before making any changes `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`, never ever make any changes directly on the master/main branch.
